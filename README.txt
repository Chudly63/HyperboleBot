Reddit Hyperbole Bot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This bot keeps track of how many times someone mentions Hitler on r/Politics

This project is meant to give me more practice with praw (Pyton Reddit API Wrapper)

The bot stores the ID's of the comments that have Hitler in them and produce a list of links to these comments.

I'm thinking about having this script run every day and produce a reddit post linking to all the "Hitler"s that were posted that day. Might be too much though considering how much
is posted to r/politics
